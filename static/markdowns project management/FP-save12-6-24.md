First Principles of Manufacturing:

Input Resources
- Raw Materials (paper, ink, vinyl)
  * Required Amount = Final Output + Process Waste + Setup Waste
  * Minimum Order Quantities
  * Shelf Life Constraints
- Energy (electricity, compressed air)
  * Startup/Shutdown Consumption
  * Idle State Usage
  * Peak Operation Usage
- Labor (operator time)
  * Setup/Calibration Time
  * Production Supervision
  * Quality Control Time

Equipment Capabilities
- Physical Constraints (min/max sizes)
  * Edge Trim Requirements
  * Registration Tolerances
- Speed/Throughput
  * Startup Stabilization Time
  * Material-Specific Speeds
  * Quality-Speed Tradeoffs
- Quality Levels
  * Setup Samples Needed
  * In-Process Testing Requirements
  * Acceptable Defect Rates
- Operating Requirements
  * Warmup Waste
  * Changeover Waste
  * Maintenance Waste

Process Steps
- Setup Time
  * Calibration Materials
  * Test Pieces
  * Approval Samples
- Running Time
  * Process Scrap Rate
  * Quality Control Samples
  * Environmental Factors
- Finishing Time
  * Edge Trim
  * Assembly Waste
  * Packaging Loss
- Quality Control
  * Inspection Samples
  * Destructive Testing
  * Archive Samples

Cost Factors
- Fixed Costs (equipment lease, facility)
  * Minimum Material Orders
  * Setup Requirements
- Variable Costs (materials, labor, energy)
  * Waste Percentage by Run Length
  * Quality Level Impact
  * Material Type Impact
- Maintenance Costs
  * Preventive Maintenance Waste
  * Breakdown Recovery Waste
- Waste/Spoilage
  * Setup Phase
  * Production Phase
  * Handling Phase

Output Measurements
- Quantity Produced
  * Gross Output
  * Net Good Output
  * Waste Output
- Quality Level Achieved
  * First Pass Yield
  * Final Yield
  * Defect Categories
- Time Taken
  * Setup Efficiency
  * Production Efficiency
  * Recovery Time
- Resources Consumed
  * Material Yield
  * Energy Efficiency
  * Labor Efficiency

Key Abstractions:
1. Equipment - A device that transforms inputs into outputs
2. Process - A defined set of steps to create something
3. Material - What gets transformed
4. Parameter - A variable that affects the process
5. Constraint - A limitation on what's possible
